### \\{^_^}/ Hey, I'm vic!

**I help engineering teams ship product faster without sacrificing security or burning cloud budget.**

5+ years turning complex systems into things that just work. Started as a full-stack developer, led frontend team, and grew into DevOps and InfoSec — currently at [minu](https://minu.mx).

#### What I can help you with?

- Build and ship — from frontend to backend to production
- Deploy with confidence — CI/CD pipelines that don't break at 2am
- Scale infrastructure without the surprise bill at the end of the month
- Bridge the gap between your dev team, your product, and your operations
- Turn AI from buzzword into working tools — bots, agents, automation
